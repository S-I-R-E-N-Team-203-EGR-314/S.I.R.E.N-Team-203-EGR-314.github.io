        </ul>

        <h2>Methodology: From Customer Reviews to Product Specifications</h2>
        <p>To determine the specifications and features that are most important to users, our team conducted a comprehensive analysis of customer reviews for existing weather-related products. We focused on products that provide essential weather information, ideal for outdoor activities like camping.</p>
        <p>We meticulously examined reviews to understand user preferences and pain points. Key aspects users highlighted included the need for devices to be lightweight and small, ensuring they are convenient to carry on trips. Users expressed a preference for weather stations to be waterproof, capable of withstanding outdoor conditions. Battery life was a critical factor; reviews favored devices with rechargeable or commonly available batteries, highlighting the inconvenience of uncommon or non-rechargeable options.</p>
        <p>Additionally, users valued the ability to switch measurement units, indicating the need for flexibility in how data is displayed. A recurring theme in the reviews was the call for user-friendly interfaces; many existing products were criticized for complex and unintuitive designs. To quantify these needs, we used a keyword analysis approach, counting how frequently terms related to each specification appeared. This helped us identify 'user-friendly' as a crucial specification, directly influencing the design considerations of our products.</p>

        <p>Through this analytical process, we translated qualitative feedback into quantifiable data, forming the basis for the product requirements that directly address user needs.</p>
