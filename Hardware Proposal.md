The Hardware proposal consisted of our team Schematic as well as out team BOM. When it came to building each of our schematics, most of them were avaible to us to create via the components datasheets. located above is the latest version of the team's Schematic, each othem sectioned off for each component; Temp sensor, Light Sensor, Motor, wifi module, and microcontroller with power supply.
