## Motavation
When it came to the design concepts for our product we wanted to use every user need we collected as well as ideas each member generated to create each concept sketch of our product. When it comes to the sketches, we knew that each sketch needed our specific parts: wind speed, direction, and atmospheric sensors. Over all, we all agreed that the concepts we made are good designs that we all can create.


I. Idea Generation

Concept 1:
Name: Molle Backpack Weather Device
Description: It’s a device that can be attached to both a tree and a backpack that provides weather readings to the user and their company.

Visual Representation:

Key Features Highlighted: It can have its battery replaced without the device being removed from the placed position. It also has a button guard around the sound alert button to prevent accidentally pushing. 


Concept 2:
Name: The Handheld S.I.R.E.N.

Description: Small and compact this device can be clipped onto a backpack so the weather can be checked at any time while also working as a weather alarm for the nights.

Visual Representation:

Key Features Highlighted:
Temperature and Humidity sensors, Rugged shockproof design, rechargeable and replaceable batteries, Flashlight, and USB Charging port

Concept 3:
Name: 
Weather Alert with extensions
Description:
This concept features an extending pole that houses both the wind speed sensor and the direction sensor. The goal with the extending pole is to allow the sensors to be more airborn to gather accurate data. While doing so, it stores the data it gathers within a SD card. Once the device comes within wifi range, it will dump the data it collected onto a linked website.

Key Features Highlighted:
The Pole will extend 6 ft into the air to allow both sensors to collect the necessary data. The screen attached to the hub will report what the sensors read.
