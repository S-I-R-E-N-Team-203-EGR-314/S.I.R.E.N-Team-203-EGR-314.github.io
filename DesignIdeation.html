        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>When it came to the design concepts for our product we wanted to use every user need we collected as well as ideas each member generated to create each concept sketch of our product. When it comes to the sketches, we knew that each sketch needed our specific parts: wind speed, direction, and atmospheric sensors. Overall, we all agreed that the concepts we made are good designs that we all can create.</p>

        <h2>Idea Generation</h2>

        <p>Figure 1 “Unsorted Ideas”</p>

        <h2>Sorting, Ranking, and Grouping of Concepts</h2>
        <p>Methods Used for Sorting/Ranking:</p>
        <p>Hardware, Design, Features, and Data were our sorting methods.</p>

        <div class="concept">
            <h3 class="concept-header">Concept 1: Molle Backpack Weather Device</h3>
            <p>Description: It’s a device that can be attached to both a tree and a backpack that provides weather readings to the user and their company.</p>
            <img src="https://github.com/S-I-R-E-N-Team-203-EGR-314/S.I.R.E.N-Team-203-EGR-314.github.io/assets/157171278/a882a2e2-9052-454d-81ae-29b5da7ce870" alt="Molle Backpack Weather Device">
            <p>Key Features Highlighted: It can have its battery replaced without the device being removed from the placed position. It also has a button guard around the sound alert button to prevent accidentally pushing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept">
            <h3 class="concept-header">Concept 2: The Handheld S.I.R.E.N.</h3>
            <p>Description: Small and compact this device can be clipped onto a backpack so the weather can be checked at any time while also working as a weather alarm for the nights.</p>
            <img src="https://github.com/S-I-R-E-N-Team-203-EGR-314/S.I.R.E.N-Team-203-EGR-314.github.io/assets/157171278/7a3927c4-b192-462a-9c58-635aec687ea6" alt="The Handheld S.I.R.E.N.">
            <p>Key Features Highlighted: Temperature and Humidity sensors, Rugged shockproof design, rechargeable and replaceable batteries, Flashlight, and USB Charging port.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept">
            <h3 class="concept-header">Concept 3: Weather Alert with Extensions</h3>
            <p>Description: This concept features an extending pole that houses both the wind speed sensor and the direction sensor. The goal with the extending pole is to allow the sensors to be more airborne to gather accurate data. While doing so, it stores the data it gathers within an SD card. Once the device comes within wifi range, it will dump the data it collected onto a linked website.</p>

            <p>Key Features Highlighted: The Pole will extend 6 ft into the air to allow both sensors to collect the necessary data. The screen attached to the hub will report what the sensors read.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Just a note: All our methods of brainstorming work.</p>

        <h2>Team Roles for this</h2>
        <p>Payton & Kyle: Finalized the design</p>
        <p>Ryan & Abel: Generated ideas</p>
